This is a picollo trombone but better because Cats
the tail is optional as it get in your face
you will need to glue the bell part 1, the bell part 2 and the nose and whiskers in order to assembeled them
the UWU mouthpiece icluded works but you will get a better sound with a trumpet or trombone mouthpiece.
